    Dutch And Armenian Cemetery is a Tomb and architecture. Great place
    right in the middle of Concrete Jungle in the metropolis. Beautiful
    memorial verses have been engraved on the tombs. Tombs of army soldiers,
    captains and their families fill up this medium sized ground. Each
    touching verse spoke about how the person had lived, how he or she
    touched their lives and how they wish his or her soul rests in peace.
